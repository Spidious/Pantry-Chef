# About the Project
Ever come home to an empty fridge? Our app helps by turning pantry ingredients into recipe ideas, reducing unnecessary trips and food waste. Save time, money, and make cooking easier!
## Inspiration
As college students having to balance rigorous course work, working a job and maintaining a social life can make it incredible difficult to meal plan on a budget. 
## What it does
Our project allows users to select ingredients that they already have in their own pantry and input them into our application. Once Pantry Chef has the user list of ingredients it provides a list of possible recipes 
## How we built it
The app is built on C#.NET written in Microsoft Visual Studio. Using a SQLite database we were able to store ingredients and recipes and query them efficiently.
## Challenges we ran into
Both of us struggled with C# and XAML in the beginning but by the end we were quickly and effectively making changes and additions. Additionally, in working around compatibility issues with Microsoft and Apple products, we had to figure out how to use git on a device where we did not have the ability to install git.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
A few of our SQL queries felt rather intense in figuring out the solution. Additionally, the images displayed on the recipes tab are not stored locally, rather they fetched from the internet.
## What we learned
We learned how to integrate SQLite with C# while using the various tools and features of Visual Studio that can often seem intimidating.
## What's next for Pantry Chef
In the future we would love to see the input of a recipe being the submission of a URL whose contents can be retrieved and inserted to the database quickly and efficiently. We would also like to have a better user experience.
